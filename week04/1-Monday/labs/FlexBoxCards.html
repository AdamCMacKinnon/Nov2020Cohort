        <p class="text">This banana looks a lot like a bird, doesn't it? When originally posted there was some debate whether it was a hummingbird, a seagull, or a crow.  I stand by my earlier statement that it is a banana.</p>

        <h1 class="text">Norwegian Boller</h1>
        <p class="text">Boller- or sweet wheat buns - is a favored snack and comfort food for Norwegians, especially enjoyed for Childrens' birthdays or on a cold and rainy/snowy day coupled with hot cocoa.
        <br><br>
        One of the key ingredients of boller is cardamom - something that gives them a distinct aroma and gives them the more lengthy name "cardamom boller".

        <p class="text">They say dinosaurs had feathers.  I prefer to think they were a bit more stylish than that, as proven by this dinosaur wearing a swanky alumininium coat.</p>

        <h1 class="text">A Sweet Surprise</h1>
        <p class="text">
            Oh yes:  Sometimes when you bake broller, you put a piece of chocolate (usually dark) in the center before baking.  That way when an unsuspecting recipient bites into the baked dliciousness they get a sweet surprise.

        <p class="text">
            You know what's better than a chocolate covered caramel filled frog from Denmark?  A chocolate covered caramel filled frog from Denmark served with juicy slices of oranges.
            <br><br>
            Did I mention I like oranges?

        <p class="text">
            The Whiskey Jack is a surprisingly large bird that likes to eat food held up by tourists.  In spite of what the image suggests, it does in fact have wings.

        <p class="text">On a recent trip to Europe my brothers and I invented a new game called "Pool Cue Jenga".  It is the best game ever invnted. <br><br>
        The rules are simple:  You must use a pool cue to remove tiles.  Only one cue can be used, and you can not use your fingers. </p>
